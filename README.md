laravelsnippets
===============

A repository of code snippets for the awesome Laravel PHP Framework. This had been open sourced to be added in the code samples of laravel framework. Pull requests are very welcome! A new responsive front-end design will also be great.

Live Site - http://laravelsnippets.tk/

Before running this site in your machine you will first need to import the .sql file found in the root of this repository to your mysql database. Name your database "laravelsnippets2", if not, you will need to make changes in the config/database.php file. Sorry if I haven't used migrations, I built this site few months ago during I'm just new in using Laravel.

NOTE:
Control panel of the administrator is not 100% done. It will throw errors especially the pages in the nav but you can still edit,view,delete and moderate submitted snippets. But temporarily you can't add snippets using the admin account so use the member account when you want to add a snippet. I haven't had the time to finish this site. I'm still rewriting the site slowly when I have free time.

Default Accounts:
